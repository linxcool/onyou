						The Product uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase

						information. In addition, the personal information you provide will allow
						The Product to send you messages regarding, among other things, new products,
						features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests
						and events of interest. You may also later opt out of certain of these
						communications. The Product may also use personal and non-personal information,
						both individually and combined together, to better understand the behavior
						and preferences of its customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to
						serve static and dynamic advertising, to enforce its Terms of Service,
						to ensure proper functioning of its products and services as well as to
						help improve Services and their content. In addition, The Product may combine
						non-personal information with personal information, such as an email address,
						to administer loyalty programs, tailor its offerings, web pages or game
						play experience to you. By use of friend finder tools whether directly
						through the Service or through a social network or gaming service, you
						acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your
						contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Service account
						(and related gaming entitlements, including games played, spins and coins)
						with your social networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting
						friends' list will be subject to this privacy policy. If you choose to
						use a referral service to "tell a friend" about a Service, The Product
						may ask you for your friend's name and email address. The Product will
						send your friend an email on your behalf or a text message inviting him
						or her to visit the relevant site or check out the Service. The Product
						stores your friend's name and email for a short period for the sole purpose
						of sending this email and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your
						friend does not receive multiple copies of the same email message. The
						Product does not keep or use this information for any other purpose. If
						you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion, The Product
						may use the information you provide to administer those programs. Your
						participation in tournaments or other online gaming events is conditional
						upon you granting The Product permission to collect, use, store, transmit
						and publicly display statistical data, such as your scores, rankings and
						achievements, generated through your participation. In all cases of data
						access and collection, the information you provide will not be disclosed,
						rented, loaned, leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated
						third parties and will be used solely for the purpose of providing you
						with and improving the Service and for any other purpose stated herein.
						The Product will retain your information for as long as your account is
						active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your
						account or request that The Product no longer use your information contact
						The Product at the email address provided in the Contact Us section below.
						Note that there may be instances where The Product is legally required
						to retain your information.
